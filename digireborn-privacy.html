      <h1 id="title">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>September 28, 2025</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Digital Reborn</strong> is an initiative run by a group of teenagers that donates refurbished technology (computers, tablets, iPads) to under-privileged communities. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect through the Digital Reborn mobile app and website, how we use it, how we protect it, and the choices available to you.</p>

      <h2>1. What this app does</h2>
      <p class="muted">Short summary</p>
      <p>Our mission is to help people who lack access to reliable devices for learning and growth and to reduce electronic waste by reusing devices. The app allows users to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account and sign in using an email and password (no third-party login providers).</li>
        <li>View a home page with options to log out or delete your account.</li>
        <li>Submit e-waste donation forms (a short survey) that go to our admins.</li>
        <li>Click a link to make monetary donations on our website (external donation page).</li>
        <li>See a history of your past donations (items and/or monetary links).</li>
        <li>View an About Us page with our founders and organization info.</li>
        <li>Use an in-app chat page to message our team with questions about donations or support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p class="muted">Minimal and purpose-driven data collection</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account info:</strong> Email address and account password. Passwords are stored as hashes (we never store plain-text passwords).</li>
        <li><strong>Donation survey data:</strong> When you create an e-waste donation, you submit survey fields (e.g., item type, condition, location, pickup details). This information is used to process and coordinate donations with our admins.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat messages:</strong> Messages you send via the in-app chat are stored so our team can respond and keep a conversation history.</li>
        <li><strong>Donation records:</strong> A record of items you donated, dates, and donation IDs (for your past-donations page).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics (optional/minimal):</strong> Non-identifying usage data such as feature usage or app crashes to help us improve the app. You can opt out where supported.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> We do not process credit card payments inside the app. If you click the monetary donation link, you will be taken to our external donations webpage (that external site will have its own payment/privacy procedures).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and operate the app features (login, donation submission, chat, account management).</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your donations, replies to chat messages, and important account notices.</li>
        <li>To review, verify, and process donation survey submissions and coordinate pickups or drop-offs.</li>
        <li>To improve the app (securely and anonymously), fix bugs, and understand usage patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. No third-party login — and third-party services</h2>
      <p>We do not use third-party login providers (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.). Login is available only via email and password.

The Digital Reborn app uses Firebase (Google LLC) as its backend infrastructure:

Firebase Authentication is used for account sign-up and sign-in. Passwords are stored only in hashed form and never in plain text.

Firebase Database (Firestore/Realtime Database) is used to store user-generated data, including donation survey submissions, past donation records, and chat messages.

Firebase Storage is used to store any images uploaded by users (such as photos of donated devices).

All data stored in Firebase is protected by Google’s security standards, including encryption in transit and at rest.

No other third-party analytics or integrations are used. If you click an external link to make a monetary donation, you will be redirected to our official donations page, which may be handled by a third-party payment processor under its own privacy policy.</p>

      <h2>5. Data storage, security, and retention</h2>
      <p class="muted">How we protect your information</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transmission security:</strong> Data sent between your device and our servers is encrypted in transit using TLS/HTTPS.</li>
        <li><strong>At-rest security:</strong> Sensitive account credentials (passwords) are stored as salted hashes. Other personal data is stored securely on our servers with access limited to authorized admins.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We keep your account, donation history, and chat messages for as long as needed to provide the service. If you request account deletion, we remove or anonymize your personal data as described below.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Your rights and choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & export:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about your account (email, donation records, chat history).</li>
        <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> From the app’s home/account page you can choose to delete your account. Deleting your account will remove your personal data from our active systems; some limited records (for legal/compliance reasons or anonymized logs) may remain for a short period but will not include identifying information.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt out of analytics:</strong> Where available you may opt out of non-essential analytics and crash reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact for requests:</strong> Use the “Contact us” details below to request data export or deletion; include your account email so we can verify the request.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>Digital Reborn does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you are under 13, please obtain parental permission before creating an account. If you are a parent and believe your child’s information is stored with us, contact us and we will remove it in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

      <h2>8. What happens when you submit a donation survey</h2>
      <p>When you create an e-waste donation through the app you will complete a short survey. That survey:
        <ul>
          <li>Is sent to our admin team so we can evaluate the item and coordinate pickup or drop-off;</li>
          <li>May include images or condition notes if you choose to add them;</li>
          <li>Is visible to our admins and stored with your account so you can see past submissions in your Donations history page.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>9. Chat feature</h2>
      <p>The app’s chat connects you with our team. Chat messages are stored so we can respond and keep context. Avoid sending extremely sensitive personal information over chat. If a support issue requires sensitive details, we will provide a secure channel to finish the request.</p>

      <h2>10. Links & external sites</h2>
      <p>Our donations page (monetary giving) opens an external website for processing payments. That site and any third-party payment processor will have their own privacy and security practices. We recommend reviewing those policies before submitting payment details.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes we will post a notice in the app and update the “Effective date” at the top of this page.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or want to make a data request (export or deletion), email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@digitalreborn.org">privacy@digitalreborn.org</a> or use the in-app chat.</p>

      <p class="small muted">If you want an immediate account action: use the app’s home/account page to log out or delete your account. If you need help, message us in chat or email the address above and include your account email so we can verify your request.</p>
